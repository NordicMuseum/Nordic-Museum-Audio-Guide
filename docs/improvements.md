There are several possible improvements, additional features that will hopefully be added to the app in the future. This list was prepared for a collaborative student project at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) that takes place during the Spring of 2020.

- Sync with other museum AV technology. Two systems to explore are [Watchout](https://www.dataton.com/products/watchout) and [Brightsign](https://docs.brightsign.biz/display/DOC/BSN+API).
- Add the possibility to stream audio from a museum server instead of bundling all audio in the initial app download.
- Fetch current information “Today at the museum” from a museum website and display in the app.
- Add the possibility to update app content from a CMS, preferably standard ones such as Wordpress. And/or improve the current process using Google Spreadsheets.
- Map views for indoor and/or outdoor use.
- Refined use of iBeacons to show nearby content.
- Add RFID as an input method in addition to entering digits.
- Add scrubbing to the audio progress bar
- Handle dark mode in iOS 13

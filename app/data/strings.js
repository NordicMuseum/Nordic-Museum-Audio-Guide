    '201_transcript': 'Benvenuti al Nordiska museet, il museo nordico, il più grande museo dedicato alla storia della cultura in Svezia. Mi chiamo Sanne Houby-Nielsen e sono la Direttrice del Museo.\n\nQuesta imponente statua raffigura Gustav Vasa, il re che unificò la Svezia nel 16esimo secolo. Il Museo vi mostrerà come viveva la popolazione in Svezia, dall’epoca di Gustav Vasa fino ai giorni nostri; le varie tipologie di abitazioni, l’abbigliamento, i piatti tipici e come celebravano i giorni memorabili. La statua è opera dello scultore svedese Carl Milles.\n\nQuando il Museo fu fondato, alla fine del 19esimo secolo, era stato ideato per esporre oggetti provenienti da tutti i Paesi Nordici, da cui è derivato il nome “Museo Nordico”. Ma attualmente si offre solamente uno spaccato del mondo svedese. Notate l’iscrizione ai piedi del re Gustav Vasa, “Warer Svenske!”, “Siate svedesi!” Il fondatore del museo, Artur Hazelius, riteneva che la passione per la storia andasse di pari passo  con il patriottismo.\n\nOggi il Museo nordico vuole raccontare le storie di tutte le persone che vivono e hanno vissuto in Svezia e nella regione nordica.\n\nQuesta visita è chiamata “Le parti salienti del Museo Nordico” e vi mostrerà alcuni tra gli oggetti e le esposizioni più interessanti del museo. Durerà circa un’ora.\n\nCercate gli stand gialli delle audioguide.\n\nPrendete l’ascensore fino al quarto piano. La visita proseguirà con la mostra dedicata alle case e all’arredamento. Vi auguro una buona visita.',

Museossa esitellään ihmisten elämää Ruotsissa Kustaa Vaasan ajoista aina nykypäivään saakka – kuinka he asuivat, miten he pukeutuivat, mitä he söivät ja kuinka he juhlistivat tärkeitä tapahtumia. Patsaan on tehnyt ruotsalainen kuvanveistäjä Carl Milles.\n\nKun museo perustettiin 1800-luvun lopulla, siellä oli tarkoitus esitellä esineitä kaikista Pohjoismaista. Siitä juontuu nimi Nordiska museet, Pohjoismainen museo. Mutta nykyään täällä esitellään vain ruotsalaisten elämää. Huomioikaa teksti kuningas Kustaa Vaasan jalkojen alla. - Warer Svenske!, Olkaa ruotsalaisia! Museon perustaja Artur Hazelius uskoi, että kiinnostus historiaa kohtaan kulki käsi kädessä isänmaallisuuden kanssa.\n\nNyt haluaisimme kertoa kaikkien Ruotsissa ja Pohjolassa asuvien ja asuneiden ihmisten tarinat.\n\nMuseon kohokohdat -kierros esittelee useita museon kiinnostavimpia esineitä ja näyttelyitä. Se kestää noin tunnin verran.\n\nEtsikää keltaisia audio-opas-telineitä.\n\nMenkää hissillä neljänteen kerrokseen. Kierros jatkuu siellä Koti ja sisustus -näyttelyn merkeissä. Toivottavasti viihdytte.',
